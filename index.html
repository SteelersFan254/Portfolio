                <p>In 2016, I started my post education at Texas State University supporting myself by working at a bar on the weekends. After spending a few years majoring in finance, I realized that the careers you go into after graduating wasn’t what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. My original plan was to switch my major to computer science but my most of my credits wouldn’t have counted so I would’ve had to start my college career over again. Instead, I went the way of attending a bootcamp at The University of Texas for full-stack web development 
                which I completed in February of 2020. Unfortunately, right as I graduated was when the Coronavirus epidemic started. The bar I was working at got shut down and that also happened to be the time my lease was up. Instead of looking for work in my field, I decided to use the opportunity to go back home and spend some time with my family. Now, I spend my week days practicing my craft while working back at the bar on the weekend and I also plan to go back to school part time to get a degree in mathematics. </p>
